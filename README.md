# 🧾 Cheque Reminder WhatsApp Bot (Ballerina)

This Ballerina script automatically reads cheque data from a Google Sheet and sends timely WhatsApp reminders using the Twilio API. It distinguishes between incoming and outgoing cheques, categorizing them by due dates (today or in 3 days), and formats context-aware messages for financial reminders.

## 📌 Prompt Used to Generate This Code

```
/code generate code for the use-case:

Fetch cheque data from a Google Sheet that contains two sheets:
- "Cheques Received"
- "Cheques Issued"

Each sheet has the following columns:
- Cheque No.
- Payee Name
- Amount
- Bank
- Cheque Date (formatted as `d-MMM-yyyy`, e.g., `21-Apr-2025`)

Process the data as follows:

1. Read and parse data from both sheets.

2. For each sheet, identify rows based on the Cheque Date:
   - Cheques due **today**
   - Cheques due **in exactly 3 days**

3. Based on the above, generate exactly four separate messages:
   - Message 1: Cheques due **in 3 days** from the "Cheques Received" sheet.
   - Message 2: Cheques due **today** from the "Cheques Received" sheet.
   - Message 3: Cheques due **in 3 days** from the "Cheques Issued" sheet.
   - Message 4: Cheques due **today** from the "Cheques Issued" sheet.

Each message should include all matching cheques, listing:
- Cheque No.
- Payee Name
- Amount
- Bank
- Cheque Date

If there are no cheques for a specific condition, skip generating that message.

4. Send each generated message as a **separate WhatsApp message** using the Twilio API.

5. Use the placeholder phone number `+1234567890` for all WhatsApp messages.

Make sure to:
- Format each message clearly for readability on WhatsApp.
- Treat both sheets independently.
- Handle the `d-MMM-yyyy` date format accurately when comparing dates.
